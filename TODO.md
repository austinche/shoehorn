# TODO

* Support authentication credentials in YAML file in /config
* Test on persistent connection to Shoeboxed
* Check whether receipts have notes (not in doc!)
* Limit results param to 50, 100, 200
* Implement cover sheets
* find\_by\_id should probably update the internal cached array.
* rshoeboxed compat mode?
* uploads support
* allow users to set page size
* allow setting params before reading so setting modified\_date doesn't result in double read
